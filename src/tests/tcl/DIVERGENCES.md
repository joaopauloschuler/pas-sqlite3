# DIVERGENCES.md — engine divergences surfaced by the 9.4 tcl-feature sweep

Bootstrapped under task **9.4.4.a**.  Each bucket clusters one symptom
across multiple `.test` files; counts reflect tests where the bucket
fires at least once.  Buckets are not root-caused here — that work
belongs to Phase 6 / 7 / 8 follow-ups.  Format:

    ## 9.4.divbug.N — <one-line symptom>
    Affects: <count> tests (<paths>).
    Symptom: ...
    Likely cause: ...
